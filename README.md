# Fuzzy-Logic
In case of union of crisp sets, we simply have to select repeated elements only once. In case of fuzzy 
sets, when there are common elements in both the fuzzy sets, we should select the element 
with maximum membership value.
The union of two fuzzy sets A and B is a fuzzy set C , written as C = A âˆª B
Graphically we can represent union operation as follow. Red and Blue membership functions 
represents the fuzzy value for elements in set A and B, respectively. Wherever these fuzzy functions 
overlaps, we have to consider the point with maximum membership value.
